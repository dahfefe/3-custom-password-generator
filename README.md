This simple, yet effective password generator will help you and your organization create strong passwords based on a pre-given set of criteria chosen by the user. The user can choose to include the following types of characters with an allowed range of characters from 8 - 128 characters: special characters, numeric characters, uppercase characters, and lowercase characters. 

I created this project for a personal challenge as well as a way to help to further increase my knowledge and growth in providing useful and effective tools that will help any organization further their cause and mission.
